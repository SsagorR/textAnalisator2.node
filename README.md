# textAnalisator2.node

I'd like to introduce You my new project called Text Analisator. Its ready version contains 2 files: 
'receivingGenres.js' and 'workingWithURL.js'.
These files are made to find text files on the website called 'http://www.textfiles.com/etext/',
get them and analise. Analising - is looking for the 10 most popular words and sending them to a
DataBase. 
File 'receivingGenres.js' get all the urls from the 'http://www.textfiles.com/etext/' and send them to the first table.
File 'workingWithURL.js get all the urls from that table and analise each of it. Then send every url and 10 most popular words to 
corresponding line in another table.
All that work is done on JavaScript, Node.js and MySQL.

There is also one another file - fetch.js. I'have been learning in it and that's why i don't wand to delete it.

This project - is second my project in analising words. First - is https://github.com/SsagorR/textAnalisator2.0 , but it's site.
It takes file and brings you most popular words.

Thank You!
